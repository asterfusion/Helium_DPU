Description: This library implements the well-behaved daemon specification of
        :pep:`3143`, “Standard daemon process library”.
        
        A well-behaved Unix daemon process is tricky to get right, but the
        required steps are much the same for every daemon program. A
        `DaemonContext` instance holds the behaviour and configured
        process environment for the program; use the instance as a context
        manager to enter a daemon state.
        
        Simple example of usage::
        
            import daemon
        
            from spam import do_main_program
        
            with daemon.DaemonContext():
                do_main_program()
        
        Customisation of the steps to become a daemon is available by
        setting options on the `DaemonContext` instance; see the
        documentation for that class for each option.
