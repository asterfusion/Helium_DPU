Description: The lockfile package exports a LockFile class which provides a simple API for
        locking files.  Unlike the Windows msvcrt.locking function, the fcntl.lockf
        and flock functions, and the deprecated posixfile module, the API is
        identical across both Unix (including Linux and Mac) and Windows platforms.
        The lock mechanism relies on the atomic nature of the link (on Unix) and
        mkdir (on Windows) system calls.  An implementation based on SQLite is also
        provided, more as a demonstration of the possibilities it provides than as
        production-quality code.
        
        Note: In version 0.9 the API changed in two significant ways:
        
         * It changed from a module defining several classes to a package containing
           several modules, each defining a single class.
        
         * Where classes had been named SomethingFileLock before the last two words
           have been reversed, so that class is now SomethingLockFile.
        
        The previous module-level definitions of LinkFileLock, MkdirFileLock and
        SQLiteFileLock will be retained until the 1.0 release.
