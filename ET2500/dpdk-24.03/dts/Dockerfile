# This image is intended to be used as the base for automated systems.
# It bakes DTS into the image during the build.

# This image is intended to be used as DTS development environment. It doesn't need C compilation
# capabilities, only Python dependencies. Once a container mounting DTS using this image is running,
# the dependencies should be installed using Poetry.
