; This is an example configuration file for dma-perf, which details the meanings of each parameter
; and instructions on how to use dma-perf.

; Supported test types are DMA_MEM_COPY and CPU_MEM_COPY.

; Parameters:
; "mem_size" denotes the size of the memory footprint.
; "buf_size" denotes the memory size of a single operation.
; "dma_ring_size" denotes the dma ring buffer size. It should be must be a power of two, and between
;  64 and 4096.
; "kick_batch" denotes the dma operation batch size, and should be greater than 1 normally.

; The format for variables is variable=first,last,increment,ADD|MUL.

; src_numa_node is used to control the numa node where the source memory is allocated.
; dst_numa_node is used to control the numa node where the destination memory is allocated.

; cache_flush is used to determine whether or not the cache should be flushed, with 1 indicating to
; flush and 0 indicating to not flush.

; test_seconds controls the test time of the whole case.

; To use DMA for a test, please specify the "lcore_dma" parameter.
; If you have already set the "-l" and "-a" parameters using EAL,
; make sure that the value of "lcore_dma" falls within their range of the values.
; We have to ensure a 1:1 mapping between the core and DMA device.

; To use CPU for a test, please specify the "lcore" parameter.
; If you have already set the "-l" and "-a" parameters using EAL,
; make sure that the value of "lcore" falls within their range of values.

; To specify a configuration file, use the "--config" flag followed by the path to the file.

; To specify a result file, use the "--result" flag followed by the path to the file.
; If you do not specify a result file, one will be generated with the same name as the configuration
; file, with the addition of "_result.csv" at the end.

; "direction" denotes the direction of data transfer. It can take 3 values:
;    0 - mem to mem transfer
;    1 - mem to dev transfer
;    2 - dev to mem transfer
;  > 3 - Bi-directional transfer
; If not specified the default value is 0 (mem to mem transfer).

; "raddr" remote address for "mem to dev" and "dev to mem" transfer.

; "scoreid" denotes source PEM index.
; "dcoreid" denotes destination PEM index.

; "skip" To skip a test-case set skip to 1.
