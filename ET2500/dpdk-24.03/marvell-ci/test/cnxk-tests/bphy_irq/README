========
OVERVIEW
========
This directory contains the test application for testing hardware
BPHY interrupts.

================
TEST APPLICATION
================
The test application demonstrates the process of initializing BPHY
interrupt subsystem, interrupt registration and handler execution.
In contrary to rawdevice selftest this application does not only
test API correctness but actually triggers real interrupts by
accessing PSM registers.

==========
HOW TO RUN
==========

The application run with no arguments will print information about correct
parameters format:

 ./bphy-irq

while the actual tests need BPHY BDF device in the following format:

 ./bphy-irq BB:DD.F

for example:

 ./bphy-irq 06:00.0

There is a dedicated test script which lists available PCI devices and
if one matches BPHY device id chooses it for execution.

Notes:
------
Works for 9k platform only.
