Odyssey ODM DMA Device Driver
=============================

The ``odm`` DMA device driver provides a poll-mode driver (PMD) for Marvell Odyssey
DMA Hardware Accelerator block found in Odyssey SoC. The block supports only mem
to mem DMA transfers.

ODM DMA device can support up to 32 queues and 16 VFs.

Prerequisites and Compilation procedure
---------------------------------------

Device Setup
-------------

ODM DMA device is initialized by kernel PF driver. The PF kernel driver is part
of Marvell software packages for Odyssey.

Kernel module can be inserted as in below example::

    $ sudo insmod odyssey_odm.ko

ODM DMA device can support up to 16 VFs::

    $ sudo echo 16 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:08\:00.0/sriov_numvfs

Above command creates 16 VFs with 2 queues each.

The ``dpdk-devbind.py`` script, included with DPDK, can be used to show the
presence of supported hardware. Running ``dpdk-devbind.py --status-dev dma``
will show all the Odyssey ODM DMA devices.

Devices using VFIO drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HW devices to be used will need to be bound to a user-space IO driver.
The ``dpdk-devbind.py`` script can be used to view the state of the devices
and to bind them to a suitable DPDK-supported driver, such as ``vfio-pci``.
For example::

     $ dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci 0000:08:00.1

Device Probing and Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the devices from an application, the dmadev API can be used.

Once configured, the device can then be made ready for use
by calling the ``rte_dma_start()`` API.

Performing Data Copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the :ref:`Enqueue / Dequeue APIs <dmadev_enqueue_dequeue>` section
of the dmadev library documentation for details on operation enqueue and
submission API usage.

Performance Tuning Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To achieve higher performance, DMA device needs to be tuned using PF kernel
driver module parameters.

Following options are exposed by kernel PF driver via devlink interface for
tuning performance.

``eng_sel``

  ODM DMA device has 2 engines internally. Engine to queue mapping is decided
  by a hardware register which can be configured as below::

    $ /sbin/devlink dev param set pci/0000:08:00.0 name eng_sel value 3435973836 cmode runtime

  Each bit in the register corresponds to one queue. Each queue would be
  associated with one engine. If the value of the bit corresponding to the queue
  is 0, then engine 0 would be picked. If it is 1, then engine 1 would be
  picked.

  In the above command, the register value is set as
  ``1100 1100 1100 1100 1100 1100 1100 1100`` which allows for alternate engines
  to be used with alternate VFs (assuming the system has 16 VFs with 2 queues
  each).

``max_load_request``

  Specifies maximum outstanding load requests on internal bus. Values can range
  from 1 to 512. Set to 512 for maximum requests in flight.::

    $ /sbin/devlink dev param set pci/0000:08:00.0 name max_load_request value 512 cmode runtime
