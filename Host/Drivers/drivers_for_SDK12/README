Overview
========
The purpose pcie_ep_octeon_host drivers is to provide the necessary linux kernel
drivers for the host side for running packet IO between host and an
Octeon CN9K or CN10K (referered collectively as CNXK) connected to that host
in PCIe Endpoint mode.


Identifying CN9K/CN10K device
=============================
#. Use lspci command to list Octeon devices on Host, as below:

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      # lspci | grep Cavium

   The above command should show an output similar to

   .. code-block:: shell-session

      01:00.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b200 /* 96xx PF  */
      01:02.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b203 /* 96xx VF0 */

      01:00.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b100 /* 98xx PF  */
      01:02.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b103 /* 98xx VF0 */

      01:00.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b400 /* F95N PF  */
      01:02.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b403 /* F95N VF0 */

      81:00.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b900 /* cn10ka PF  */
      81:02.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device b903 /* cn10ka VF0 */

      81:00.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device ba00 /* cnf10ka PF  */
      81:02.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device ba03 /* cnf10ka VF0 */

      81:00.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device bc00 /* cnf10kb PF  */
      81:02.0 Network controller: Cavium, Inc. Device bc03 /* cnf10kb VF0 */

   The PCI BDFs in the above example will vary from system to system.


Building the Drivers
====================
#. Install the kernel development headers
#. Run "make" from top level directory.

   .. code-block:: shell-session

     # make

#. Find below kernel modules (.ko files) generated once make is finished.

   .. code-block:: shell-session

     ./drivers/octboot_net/octboot_net.ko
     ./drivers/octeon_ep_vf/octeon_ep_vf.ko
     ./drivers/phc/oct_ep_phc.ko
     ./drivers/octeon_ep/octeon_ep.ko

Testing the Drivers
===================
Testing the host drivers requires bring up of software on Octeon
along with the host drivers.

Refer PCIE-EP section in SDK documentation for instructions on how to
bring up host drivers along with software on Octeon.
