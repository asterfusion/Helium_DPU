	help
	  Marvell Utility Bus provides set of drivers allowing communication
	  with various services provided by firmware for OcteonTX2
	  based platforms.
	  These drivers are useful only for Marvell CN9X and CN10X SoCs.
	  If unsure, say N here.

	default y
	depends on MARVELL_UB && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
	help
	  The generic driver provides a generic implementation of
	  platform detection and firmware services.
	  By default the drvier handles CN9X and CN10X platforms.
	  If unsure, say Y here.

	  The module provides an interface to change MAC addresses assigned
	  to the network devices.
	  Driver is supported only for CN10K platform.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config MARVELL_SFP_INFO
	bool "Marvell SFP info sysfs interface"
	depends on HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
	select MARVELL_UB_GEN_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for sysfs entries to dump SFP module information
	  in similar way as the 'ethtool -m <etxX>' command.
	  The driver handles both t9x and cn10k platforms.
	  If unsure, say N here.

	select MARVELL_UB_GEN_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	  Enable sysfs interface providing basic control
	  over Retimer device for cnf10kb platform.
	  Each of the four devices will expose simple
	  interface for setting GSERM index that is to be
	  routed through the MUX and the ethernet mode -
	  - both effective from the next boot.
	  Currently, works only with cn10k platforms
	  If unsure, say N here.

config MARVELL_PORTM_BOOT_CFG
	bool "Marvell PORTM boot mode configuration interface"
	depends on HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
	select MARVELL_UB_GEN_DRIVER

	select MARVELL_UB_GEN_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	  The module enables configuration interface for the persistent data
	  memory region. The interface allows to control the size of the region.
	  The new value is used after platform reboot.
	  Only Octeon 10x platform are supported by this module.
	  If unsure, say N here.

	tristate "Memory POST configuration utility"
	depends on HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
	select MARVELL_UB_GEN_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	  This option enables a module that provides sysfs entries to manipulate
	  configuration of the power-on self test for memory executed
	  at warm and cold boot.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config MARVELL_AVS_RESET
	tristate "AVS bus reset support"
	depends on HAVE_ARM_SMCCC
	select MARVELL_UB_GEN_DRIVER
	default n
	help
	  This module enable control over AVS bus reset from Linux userspace.
	  Userspace process can signalize upcoming platform warm boot to AVS
	  devices. Operation allows for clean shutdown for the AVS devices.
	  The module supports only CN9X platforms.
	  If unsure, say N here.
