config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	tristate "OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI Endpoint console driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI
	default y
	help
	  Select this option to enable the PCI console driver when
	  OcteonTX2/CN10K is configured as an Endpoint.  This allows the
	  host [PC] to connect to the Linux console via PCI
	  (using the host remote console utility).
	  To enable this console, specify 'console=pci0' on the kernel
	  command line.
	  To compile this as a module, choose M here.  However, when used
	  as a module, some kernel boot messages may be missing from the
	  console.

config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_DEBUG
	bool "OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI Endpoint console driver verbose debug messages"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console driver
	  to write verbose debug messages to the system log.  Select this
	  if you are having a problem with the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console
	  and want to see more details of the console's operation.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_TRACE
	bool "OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI Endpoint console driver trace messages"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	depends on DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console driver
	  to write verbose debug messages to the dynamic ftrace infrastructure.
	  Select this if you are having a problem with the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console
	  and want to see more details of the parts that are not debuggable
	  with traditional prints coming from OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_DEBUG.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config GTI_WATCHDOG
	tristate "GTI Watchdog driver"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  GTI Watchdog driver, provides ioctl's for applications to
	  setup and enable the NMI Watchdog and also provides
	  an mmap() interface to map GTI device memory into process
	  address space for the application to directly poke the
	  GTI watchdog without any kernel support and entry.

config HW_CSR_ACCESS
	tristate "Access HW Device Config Space"
	default m
	depends on OCTEONTX2_AF
	help
 	  provides an interface which enables user space utility to read from or to write
	  to HW Device Config Space Registers, Contexts, Memory.

config OCTEONTX_SERDES
	tristate "OcteonTX2 serdes debug commands"
	default m
	depends on ARM64 && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Provides debugfs commands which allows to collect serdes information,
	  capture eye, use PRBS, configure serdes in loopback mode, and
	  read/write TX tuning parameters.

config MARVELL_FWLOG
	tristate "firmware log interface"
	depends on ARM64
	help
	  Provides interface to read firmware boot logs. Firmware bootlogs are saved
	  in memory that is accessible from kernel. Enabling this option allows the
	  user to dump the firmware boot logs.

	  Firmware needs to build with `RECORD_FWLOG=1` to see the boot logs and
	  U-boot config `CONFIG_FWLOG_TTYMEM` is also required to have this feature
	  validated from linux.

	  Say Y here if you want to dump the firmware boot logs from linux shell. This
	  option is available only for Octeon10 and OcteonTX2 platforms.

config MVMDIO_UIO
	tristate "Marvell MDIO interface driver"
	  default m
	select MDIO_THUNDER
	help
	  Select this option if you want to provide an interface for userspace
	  PHY drivers to access Marvell's MDIO bus.

config MARVELL_CN10K_SERDES_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell SerDes diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable SerDes diagnostics
	  interface for performing PRBS, setting Loopback mode or
	  reading/writing Tx/Rx tuning parameters.

config MRVL_PHY_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell PHY diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want an additional interface for
	  extended diagnostics functions for the PHY. This complements
	  functionality offered by ethtool. Requires PHY driver support in ATF.

config OCTEONTX2_GHES_BERT

	depends on ARM64 && ACPI_APEI
	default y
	help
	  Select this option to enable reporting of fatal Marvell GHES
	  errors on subsequent Linux boot.  Normally, fatal errors will
	  reset the system.  Enabling support here will allow such errors
	  to be reported when Linux is started again.

config OCTEONTX2_EINJ
	tristate "OcteonTX2 ECC Injection"
	help
	  Provides support for error injection to OcteonTX2
	  memory controllers (LMC) and cache blocks.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here. The module will be
	  called otx2-einj.
	  Unless testing, say N here.

config OCTEONTX2_GHES
	bool "OcteonTX2 GHES support"

	default y
	help
	  This driver configures the SDP RVU PF when OcteonTx is in PCIe EndPoint
	  mode. It sets up the SDP rings  and the VFs to be used in packet transfer
	  using the NIX block.
