Marvell OCTEON TX2 End Point Rawdev Driver
==========================================

OCTEON TX2 has an internal SDP unit which provides End Point mode of operation
by exposing its IOQs to Host, IOQs are used for packet IO between Host and
OCTEON TX2. Each OCTEON TX2 SDP PF function supports a max of 128 VF functions.
Each VF function is associated with max of eight(8) IOQs exposed to Host with
SR-IOV enabled.

Features
--------

This SDP End Point mode PMD supports

#. Packet Input - Host to OCTEON TX2 with direct data instruction mode.

#. Packet Output - OCTEON TX2 to Host with info pointer mode.

Config File Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options can be modified in the ``config`` file.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_OCTEONTX2_EP_RAWDEV`` (default ``y``)

  Toggle compilation of the ``lrte_pmd_octeontx2_ep`` driver.

Initialization
--------------

The number of SDP VFs enabled can be controlled by setting sysfs
entry, `sriov_numvfs` for the corresponding PF driver.

.. code-block:: console

 echo <num_vfs> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-ep/0000\:04\:00.0/sriov_numvfs

Once the required VFs are enabled, to be accessible from DPDK, VFs need to be
bound to vfio-pci driver.

Device Setup
------------

The OCTEON TX2 SDP End Point h/w devices will need to be bound to a
user-space IO driver for use. The script ``dpdk-devbind.py`` script
included with DPDK can be used to view the state of the devices and to bind
them to a suitable DPDK-supported kernel driver. When querying the status
of the devices, they will appear under the category of "Misc (rawdev)
devices", i.e. the command ``dpdk-devbind.py --status-dev misc`` can be
used to see the state of those devices alone.

Device Configuration
--------------------

Configuring SDP EP rawdev device is done using the ``rte_rawdev_configure()``
API, which takes the mempool as parameter. PMD uses this pool to send/receive
packets to/from the HW.

The following code shows how the device is configured

.. code-block:: c

   struct sdp_rawdev_info config = {0};
   struct rte_rawdev_info rdev_info = {.dev_private = &config};
   config.enqdeq_mpool = (void *)rte_mempool_create(...);

   rte_rawdev_configure(dev_id, (rte_rawdev_obj_t)&rdev_info);

Performing Data Transfer
------------------------

To perform data transfer using SDP VF EP rawdev devices use standard
``rte_rawdev_enqueue_buffers()`` and ``rte_rawdev_dequeue_buffers()`` APIs.

Test
----

On EAL initialization, SDP VF devices will be probed and populated into the
raw devices. The rawdev ID of the device can be obtained using

* Invoke ``rte_rawdev_get_dev_id("SDPEP:x")`` from the test application
  where x is the VF device's bus id specified in "bus:device.func"(BDF)
  format. Use this index for further rawdev function calls.

* The test application, ``octeontx2_ep_perf`` located in the ``examples``
  sub-directory, does packet IO tests and can send/receive raw data
  packets to/from the End Point device.
